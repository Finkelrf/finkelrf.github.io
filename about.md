Hi, my name is Rafael, I'm a computer engineer from Brazil, and I love to make and modify stuff. My interest goes from programing, microcontrollers and other embedded computer stuff to less computer related stuff like 3d printing and even less computer related stuff like aquaponics.

I'll use this blog to organize and document the personal projects I do and also to improve my writing skills. This blog is mainly written for me but making it available online I hope to help people with the same interests as me.

Fell free to contact me over e-mail at finkel.rf@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-finkelstein-37589033/).

Thank you, enjoy the blog.
